# SearchAndReconcileRequestBean
## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **expand** | **String** | Use [expand](#expansion) to include additional information about issues in the response. Note that, unlike the majority of instances where &#x60;expand&#x60; is specified, &#x60;expand&#x60; is defined as a comma-delimited string of values. The expand options are:   *  &#x60;renderedFields&#x60; Returns field values rendered in HTML format.  *  &#x60;names&#x60; Returns the display name of each field.  *  &#x60;schema&#x60; Returns the schema describing a field type.  *  &#x60;transitions&#x60; Returns all possible transitions for the issue.  *  &#x60;operations&#x60; Returns all possible operations for the issue.  *  &#x60;editmeta&#x60; Returns information about how each field can be edited.  *  &#x60;changelog&#x60; Returns a list of recent updates to an issue, sorted by date, starting from the most recent.  *  &#x60;versionedRepresentations&#x60; Instead of &#x60;fields&#x60;, returns &#x60;versionedRepresentations&#x60; a JSON array containing each version of a field&#39;s value, with the highest numbered item representing the most recent version.  Examples: &#x60;\&quot;names,changelog\&quot;&#x60; Returns the display name of each field as well as a list of recent updates to an issue. | [optional] [default to null] |
| **fields** | **List** | A list of fields to return for each issue. Use it to retrieve a subset of fields. This parameter accepts a comma-separated list. Expand options include:   *  &#x60;*all&#x60; Returns all fields.  *  &#x60;*navigable&#x60; Returns navigable fields.  *  &#x60;id&#x60; Returns only issue IDs.  *  Any issue field, prefixed with a dash to exclude.  The default is &#x60;id&#x60;.  Examples:   *  &#x60;summary,comment&#x60; Returns the summary and comments fields only.  *  &#x60;*all,-comment&#x60; Returns all fields except comments.  Multiple &#x60;fields&#x60; parameters can be included in a request.  Note: By default, this resource returns IDs only. This differs from [GET issue](#api-rest-api-2-issue-issueIdOrKey-get) where the default is all fields. | [optional] [default to null] |
| **fieldsByKeys** | **Boolean** | Reference fields by their key (rather than ID). The default is &#x60;false&#x60;. | [optional] [default to null] |
| **jql** | **String** | A [JQL](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/egORLQ) expression. For performance reasons, this parameter requires a bounded query. A bounded query is a query with a search restriction.   *  Example of an unbounded query: &#x60;order by key desc&#x60;.  *  Example of a bounded query: &#x60;assignee &#x3D; currentUser() order by key&#x60;.  Additionally, &#x60;orderBy&#x60; clause can contain a maximum of 7 fields. | [optional] [default to null] |
| **maxResults** | **Integer** | The maximum number of items to return per page. To manage page size, API may return fewer items per page where a large number of fields are requested. The greatest number of items returned per page is achieved when requesting &#x60;id&#x60; or &#x60;key&#x60; only. It returns max 5000 issues. | [optional] [default to 50] |
| **nextPageToken** | **String** | The token for a page to fetch that is not the first page. The first page has a &#x60;nextPageToken&#x60; of &#x60;null&#x60;. Use the &#x60;nextPageToken&#x60; to fetch the next page of issues. | [optional] [default to null] |
| **properties** | **List** | A list of up to 5 issue properties to include in the results. This parameter accepts a comma-separated list. | [optional] [default to null] |
| **reconcileIssues** | **List** | Strong consistency issue ids to be reconciled with search results. Accepts max 50 ids | [optional] [default to null] |
